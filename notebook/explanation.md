## Introduction

This Jupyter Notebook implements a **hybrid recommender system** that suggests anime titles to users based on their past ratings and anime metadata (e.g., genres, synopsis). The system combines **collaborative filtering** (using neural embeddings) and **content-based filtering** (using anime similarities) to provide personalized recommendations. The dataset used includes user ratings (`animelist.csv`), anime metadata (`anime.csv`), and anime synopses (`anime_with_synopsis.csv`).

The code is designed to:
- Load and preprocess data.
- Build a neural network model to learn user and anime embeddings.
- Train the model to predict user ratings.
- Use embeddings to find similar users and animes.
- Combine user-based and content-based recommendations into a hybrid system.
- Visualize results, such as training metrics and genre word clouds.

This explanation assumes you are a beginner in Python, ML, AI, and Data Science, so it will break down each line of code, explain its purpose, and provide the theoretical context. It also includes a structure plan to show how the code is organized and why each part is significant.

## Research Context and Background

### Recommender Systems Overview
Recommender systems are algorithms that suggest items (e.g., movies, books, products) to users based on their preferences or behavior. They are widely used in platforms like Netflix, Amazon, and Spotify. There are three main types:
1. **Collaborative Filtering**: Recommends items based on user behavior (e.g., ratings, purchases). It assumes users with similar preferences will like similar items.
2. **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends items based on item features (e.g., genres, descriptions). It suggests items similar to those a user has liked before.
3. **Hybrid Systems**: Combine collaborative and content-based filtering to improve recommendation quality by leveraging both user behavior and item features.

This notebook implements a hybrid system, using collaborative filtering (via neural embeddings) and content-based filtering (via anime metadata).

### Collaborative Filtering
- **Concept**: Collaborative filtering predicts a user's preference for an item based on the preferences of similar users. It relies on a user-item interaction matrix (e.g., ratings).
- **Matrix Factorization**: A common technique in collaborative filtering, where users and items are represented as vectors (embeddings) in a shared latent space. The dot product of a user and item embedding predicts the rating.
- **Neural Embeddings**: Instead of traditional matrix factorization (e.g., SVD), this notebook uses a neural network to learn embeddings, allowing for more complex patterns.

### Content-Based Filtering
- **Concept**: Content-based filtering recommends items based on their features (e.g., genres, synopsis). It calculates similarity between items (e.g., using cosine similarity) and suggests items similar to those a user likes.
- **Features Used**: In this notebook, anime embeddings (learned from the neural network) are used to compute similarity, rather than raw features like genres or synopsis text.

### Hybrid Recommender Systems
- **Why Hybrid?**: Collaborative filtering struggles with the **cold start problem** (new users or items with no ratings) and sparsity (few ratings for some items). Content-based filtering struggles with limited diversity (recommending only similar items). A hybrid system mitigates these issues by combining both approaches.
- **Implementation**: This notebook weights user-based (collaborative) and content-based recommendations equally (0.5 each) to produce a final list of recommendations.

### Why Anime Recommendations?
Anime recommendation systems are popular in research and practice due to:
- **Rich Datasets**: Public datasets like MyAnimeList provide user ratings, anime metadata, and synopses.
- **Diverse Features**: Anime have varied genres, themes, and synopses, making them ideal for content-based filtering.
- **Engaged Community**: Anime fans are active online, providing ample user interaction data for collaborative filtering.
- **Real-World Relevance**: Platforms like Crunchyroll and Funimation use recommender systems to enhance user experience.

The research behind this notebook likely draws from:
- **Matrix Factorization Literature**: Techniques like SVD and neural embeddings for collaborative filtering (e.g., papers by Koren et al., 2009).
- **Neural Recommender Systems**: Use of deep learning for recommendation (e.g., Neural Collaborative Filtering by He et al., 2017).
- **Hybrid Systems**: Combining collaborative and content-based methods (e.g., Burke, 2002).

   - Use dot product to predict ratings, followed by dense layers and normalization.

5. **Training the Model**:
   - Compile the model with loss function and metrics.
   - Implement learning rate scheduling and callbacks (e.g., early stopping, checkpointing).
   - Train the model on the training data.

6. **Visualizing Training Metrics**:
   - Plot loss, MAE, and MSE for training and validation sets to evaluate model performance.

7. **Extracting Embeddings**:
   - Extract learned user and anime embeddings for similarity calculations.

8. **Loading Anime Metadata**:
   - Load and clean `anime.csv` and `anime_with_synopsis.csv`.
   - Define helper functions to retrieve anime names and synopses.

9. **Content-Based Recommendations**:
   - Compute similarity between animes using embeddings.
   - Recommend animes similar to a given anime.

10. **User-Based Recommendations**:
    - Find similar users based on embeddings.
    - Recommend animes liked by similar users.

11. **Hybrid Recommender System**:
    - Combine user-based and content-based recommendations with weighted scores.
    - Return a final list of recommended animes.

12. **Visualization**:
    - Generate a word cloud to visualize a user's preferred genres.

This structure ensures a modular approach, making it easy to understand and extend the system.

## Detailed Code Explanation

Below is a line-by-line explanation of the code, including its purpose, significance, and the underlying theory. Each section corresponds to the structure plan above.

### Imports and Setup

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```
- **Purpose**: Import core libraries for data manipulation (`pandas`), numerical operations (`numpy`), and plotting (`matplotlib`).
- **Significance**: These libraries are foundational for data science tasks:
  - `pandas`: Handles tabular data (e.g., CSV files) with DataFrames.
  - `numpy`: Provides efficient array operations for numerical computations.
  - `matplotlib`: Creates visualizations like plots and word clouds.
- **Theory**: Data science workflows rely on these libraries for data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Activation, BatchNormalization, Input, Embedding, Dot, Dense, Flatten
from tensorflow.keras.callbacks import ModelCheckpoint, LearningRateScheduler, TensorBoard, EarlyStopping
```
- **Purpose**: Import TensorFlow and Keras components for building and training the neural network.
- **Significance**:
  - `tensorflow`: A deep learning framework for building neural networks.
  - `keras`: A high-level API within TensorFlow for defining models.
  - `layers`: Specific layers (e.g., `Embedding`, `Dense`) for constructing the model.
  - `Model`: Defines the neural network architecture.
  - `Adam`: An optimizer for training the model.
  - `callbacks`: Tools like `ModelCheckpoint` (saves best model), `LearningRateScheduler` (adjusts learning rate), `EarlyStopping` (stops training if performance plateaus).
- **Theory**: Neural networks require layers to process data, optimizers to minimize loss, and callbacks to monitor training.

```python
from wordcloud import WordCloud
%matplotlib inline
```
- **Purpose**: Import `WordCloud` for visualizing genres and set `matplotlib` to display plots inline in Jupyter.
- **Significance**: Word clouds visually represent text frequency, and `%matplotlib inline` ensures plots appear in the notebook.
- **Theory**: Visualization aids in understanding data patterns (e.g., user preferences).

### Reading and Processing Data

```python
import os
INPUT_DIR = os.path.join("..","artifacts","raw")
rating_df = pd.read_csv(INPUT_DIR+"/animelist.csv", low_memory=True, usecols=["user_id","anime_id","rating"])
rating_df.head()
len(rating_df)
```
- **Purpose**: Load the `animelist.csv` file, which contains user ratings for animes, and display its size.
- **Significance**:
  - `os.path.join`: Constructs a file path to the dataset.
  - `pd.read_csv`: Reads the CSV into a DataFrame, using `low_memory=True` for efficiency and `usecols` to select relevant columns (`user_id`, `anime_id`, `rating`).
  - `rating_df.head()`: Displays the first 5 rows for inspection.
  - `len(rating_df)`: Shows the number of ratings.
- **Theory**: The `animelist.csv` file is a user-item interaction matrix, crucial for collaborative filtering. Reducing columns improves memory efficiency.

### Data Preprocessing

```python
n_ratings = rating_df["user_id"].value_counts()
rating_df = rating_df[rating_df["user_id"].isin(n_ratings[n_ratings>=400].index)].copy()
len(rating_df)
```
- **Purpose**: Filter users with at least 400 ratings to reduce noise and focus on active users.
- **Significance**:
  - `value_counts()`: Counts how many ratings each user has given.
  - `n_ratings>=400`: Identifies users with 400+ ratings.
  - `isin`: Filters the DataFrame to keep only these users.
- **Theory**: Sparse data (few ratings per user) can degrade collaborative filtering performance. Filtering active users improves model reliability.

```python
min_rating = min(rating_df["rating"])
max_rating = max(rating_df["rating"])
avg_rating = np.mean(rating_df["rating"])
rating_df["rating"] = rating_df["rating"].apply(lambda x: (x-min_rating)/(max_rating-min_rating)).values.astype(np.float64)
```
- **Purpose**: Normalize ratings to a [0, 1] scale for better model training.
- **Significance**:
  - `min_rating`, `max_rating`: Find the range of ratings (e.g., 1 to 10).
  - `apply(lambda x: ...)`: Applies min-max normalization: `(x - min) / (max - min)`.
  - `.values.astype(np.float64)`: Converts ratings to 64-bit floats for numerical stability.
- **Theory**: Normalization ensures ratings are on a consistent scale, which helps neural networks converge faster and predict accurately.

```python
rating_df.duplicated().sum()
rating_df.isnull().sum()
```
- **Purpose**: Check for duplicate rows and missing values.
- **Significance**: Ensures data quality. Duplicates or missing values can skew model training.
- **Theory**: Clean data is critical for ML models to avoid biased or erroneous predictions.

```python
user_ids = rating_df["user_id"].unique().tolist()
user2user_encoded = {x: i for i, x in enumerate(user_ids)}
user2user_decoded = {i: x for i, x in enumerate(user_ids)}
rating_df["user"] = rating_df["user_id"].map(user2user_encoded)
n_users = len(user2user_encoded)
```
- **Purpose**: Encode user IDs into numerical indices for the neural network.
- **Significance**:
  - `unique().tolist()`: Gets unique user IDs.
  - `user2user_encoded`: Maps each user ID to a unique index (e.g., `11054 -> 12`).
  - `user2user_decoded`: Reverse mapping for decoding.
  - `map`: Adds an encoded `user` column to the DataFrame.
  - `n_users`: Total number of unique users.
- **Theory**: Neural networks require numerical inputs. Encoding categorical variables (user IDs) is standard in ML.

```python
anime_ids = rating_df["anime_id"].unique().tolist()
anime2anime_encoded = {x: i for i, x in enumerate(anime_ids)}
anime2anime_decoded = {i: x for i, x in enumerate(anime_ids)}
rating_df["anime"] = rating_df["anime_id"].map(anime2anime_encoded)
n_anime = len(anime2anime_encoded)
```
- **Purpose**: Encode anime IDs similarly to user IDs.
- **Significance**: Same as user encoding, but for anime IDs. Creates `anime` column and counts unique animes (`n_anime`).
- **Theory**: Encoding ensures the model can process categorical anime IDs.

```python
rating_df = rating_df.sample(frac=1, random_state=43).reset_index(drop=True)
X = rating_df[["user", "anime"]].values
y = rating_df["rating"]
test_size = 1000
train_indices = rating_df.shape[0] - test_size
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = (
    X[:train_indices],
    X[train_indices:],
    y[:train_indices],
    y[train_indices:],
)
X_train_array = [X_train[:, 0], X_train[:, 1]]
X_test_array = [X_test[:, 0], X_test[:, 1]]
```
- **Purpose**: Shuffle data, split into training and test sets, and prepare inputs for the model.
- **Significance**:
  - `sample(frac=1, random_state=43)`: Shuffles the DataFrame randomly (seed for reproducibility).
  - `X`: Array of `[user, anime]` pairs.
  - `y`: Array of normalized ratings.
  - `train_indices`: Splits data into training (all but last 1000 rows) and test sets.
  - `X_train_array`, `X_test_array`: Splits `X` into separate arrays for user and anime indices (required by the model’s two inputs).
- **Theory**: Splitting data into training and test sets evaluates model performance on unseen data. Shuffling prevents bias from data order.

### Model Architecture

```python
def RecommenderNet():
    embedding_size = 128
    user = Input(name="user", shape=[1])
    user_embedding = Embedding(name="user_embedding", input_dim=n_users, output_dim=embedding_size)(user)
    anime = Input(name="anime", shape=[1])
    anime_embedding = Embedding(name="anime_embedding", input_dim=n_anime, output_dim=embedding_size)(anime)
    x = Dot(name="dot_product", normalize=True, axes=2)([user_embedding, anime_embedding])
    x = Flatten()(x)
    x = Dense(1, kernel_initializer='he_normal')(x)
    x = BatchNormalization()(x)
    x = Activation("sigmoid")(x)
    model = Model(inputs=[user, anime], outputs=x)
    model.compile(loss="binary_crossentropy", metrics=["mae", "mse"], optimizer='Adam')
    return model
model = RecommenderNet()
model.summary()
```
- **Purpose**: Define a neural network to learn user and anime embeddings and predict ratings.
- **Significance**:
  - `embedding_size = 128`: Each user and anime is represented as a 128-dimensional vector.
  - `Input`: Defines two inputs: user and anime IDs (shape `[1]` for single values).
  - `Embedding`: Maps user/anime IDs to dense vectors (e.g., `n_users` users to 128D vectors).
  - `Dot(normalize=True)`: Computes cosine similarity between user and anime embeddings.
  - `Flatten`: Converts the dot product output to a single value.
  - `Dense`: Adds a single neuron to produce the final prediction.
  - `BatchNormalization`: Normalizes activations to stabilize training.
  - `Activation("sigmoid")`: Maps output to [0, 1] (matches normalized ratings).
  - `compile`: Sets loss (`binary_crossentropy` for [0, 1] outputs), metrics (`mae`, `mse`), and optimizer (`Adam`).
  - `model.summary()`: Displays the model architecture.
- **Theory**: This is a neural collaborative filtering model (He et al., 2017). Embeddings capture latent factors (e.g., user preferences, anime characteristics). The dot product predicts ratings, and cosine normalization ensures similarity-based predictions.

### Training the Model

```python
start_lr = 0.00001
min_lr = 0.0001
max_lr = 0.00005
batch_size = 10000
ramup_epochs = 5
sustain_epochs = 0
exp_decay = 0.8
def lrfn(epoch):
    if epoch < ramup_epochs:
        return (max_lr - start_lr) / ramup_epochs * epoch + start_lr
    elif epoch < ramup_epochs + sustain_epochs:
        return max_lr
    else:
        return (max_lr - min_lr) * exp_decay ** (epoch - ramup_epochs - sustain_epochs) + min_lr
lr_callback = LearningRateScheduler(lambda epoch: lrfn(epoch), verbose=0)
checkpoint_filepath = './weights.weights.h5'
model_checkpoint = ModelCheckpoint(filepath=checkpoint_filepath, save_weights_only=True, monitor="val_loss", mode="min", save_best_only=True)
early_stopping = EarlyStopping(patience=3, monitor="val_loss", mode="min", restore_best_weights=True)
my_callbacks = [model_checkpoint, lr_callback, early_stopping]
history = model.fit(
    x=X_train_array,
    y=y_train,
    batch_size=batch_size,
    epochs=20,
    verbose=1,
    validation_data=(X_test_array, y_test),
    callbacks=my_callbacks
)
model.load_weights(checkpoint_filepath)
```
- **Purpose**: Train the model with a custom learning rate schedule and save the best weights.
- **Significance**:
  - `start_lr`, `min_lr`, `max_lr`: Define learning rate bounds.
  - `lrfn`: Implements a learning rate schedule: linear ramp-up for 5 epochs, then exponential decay.
  - `LearningRateScheduler`: Adjusts learning rate per epoch.
  - `ModelCheckpoint`: Saves the model weights with the lowest validation loss.
  - `EarlyStopping`: Stops training if validation loss doesn’t improve for 3 epochs.
  - `model.fit`: Trains the model for 20 epochs with batch size 10,000, using training and validation data.
  - `load_weights`: Loads the best weights saved by `ModelCheckpoint`.
- **Theory**: Learning rate scheduling improves convergence. Callbacks like `EarlyStopping` prevent overfitting. `binary_crossentropy` is suitable for [0, 1] outputs, and `mae`/`mse` evaluate prediction accuracy.

### Visualizing Training Metrics

```python
metrics = ["loss", "mae", "mse"]
fig, axes = plt.subplots(len(metrics), 1, figsize=(8, len(metrics) * 4))
for i, metric in enumerate(metrics):
    ax = axes[i]
    ax.plot(history.history[metric][0:-2], marker="o", label=f"train {metric}")
    ax.plot(history.history[f"val_{metric}"][0:-2], label=f"test {metric}")
    ax.set_title(f"Model {metric.capitalize()}")
    ax.set_ylabel(metric.capitalize())
    ax.set_xlabel("Epoch")
    ax.legend(loc="upper left")
    ax.grid(True)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```
- **Purpose**: Plot training and validation metrics (loss, MAE, MSE) to evaluate model performance.
- **Significance**:
  - `history.history`: Contains training and validation metrics per epoch.
  - `plt.subplots`: Creates subplots for each metric.
  - `plot`: Plots training and validation curves, excluding the last two epochs (likely due to early stopping).
  - `tight_layout`: Adjusts subplot spacing.
- **Theory**: Visualization helps assess overfitting (if validation metrics diverge from training) and model performance.

### Extracting Embeddings

```python
def extract_weights(name, model):
    weight_layer = model.get_layer(name)
    weights = weight_layer.get_weights()[0]
    weights = weights / np.linalg.norm(weights, axis=1).reshape((-1, 1))
    return weights
anime_weights = extract_weights("anime_embedding", model)
user_weights = extract_weights("user_embedding", model)
```
- **Purpose**: Extract and normalize user and anime embeddings for similarity calculations.
- **Significance**:
  - `get_layer`: Retrieves the embedding layer.
  - `get_weights()[0]`: Gets the embedding matrix.
  - `np.linalg.norm`: Normalizes embeddings to unit length (for cosine similarity).
- **Theory**: Normalized embeddings allow similarity comparisons using dot products (cosine similarity).

### Loading Anime Metadata

```python
df = pd.read_csv(INPUT_DIR+"/anime.csv", low_memory=True)
df = df.replace("Unknown", np.nan)
def getAnimeName(anime_id):
    try:
        name = df[df.anime_id == anime_id].eng_version.values[0]
        if name is np.nan:
            name = df[df.anime_id == anime_id].Name.values[0]
    except:
        print("Error")
    return name
df["anime_id"] = df["MAL_ID"]
df["eng_version"] = df["English name"]
df["eng_version"] = df.anime_id.apply(lambda x: getAnimeName(x))
df.sort_values(by=["Score"], inplace=True, ascending=False, kind="quicksort", na_position="last")
df = df[["anime_id", "eng_version", "Score", "Genres", "Episodes", "Type", "Premiered", "Members"]]
def getAnimeFrame(anime, df):
    if isinstance(anime, int):
        return df[df.anime_id == anime]
    if isinstance(anime, str):
        return df[df.eng_version == anime]
cols = ["MAL_ID", "Name", "Genres", "sypnopsis"]
synopsis_df = pd.read_csv(INPUT_DIR+"/anime_with_synopsis.csv", usecols=cols)
def getSynopsis(anime, synopsis_df):
    if isinstance(anime, int):
        return synopsis_df[synopsis_df.MAL_ID == anime].sypnopsis.values[0]
    if isinstance(anime, str):
        return synopsis_df[synopsis_df.Name == anime].sypnopsis.values[0]
```
- **Purpose**: Load and clean anime metadata (`anime.csv`, `anime_with_synopsis.csv`) and define helper functions.
- **Significance**:
  - `replace("Unknown", np.nan)`: Handles missing data.
  - `getAnimeName`: Retrieves English or Japanese name for an anime ID.
  - `sort_values`: Sorts animes by score for reference.
  - `getAnimeFrame`, `getSynopsis`: Helper functions to retrieve anime details by ID or name.
- **Theory**: Metadata enriches recommendations with interpretable features (e.g., genres, synopses).

### Content-Based Recommendations

```python
def find_similar_animes(name, anime_weights, anime2anime_encoded, anime2anime_decoded, df, synopsis_df, n=10, return_dist=False, neg=False):
    index = getAnimeFrame(name, df).anime_id.values[0]
    encoded_index = anime2anime_encoded.get(index)
    weights = anime_weights
    dists = np.dot(weights, weights[encoded_index])
    sorted_dists = np.argsort(dists)
    n = n + 1
    if neg:
        closest = sorted_dists[:n]
    else:
        closest = sorted_dists[-n:]
    if return_dist:
        return dists, closest
    SimilarityArr = []
    for close in closest:
        decoded_id = anime2anime_decoded.get(close)
        anime_frame = getAnimeFrame(decoded_id, df)
        anime_name = anime_frame.eng_version.values[0]
        genre = anime_frame.Genres.values[0]
        similarity = dists[close]
        SimilarityArr.append({"anime_id": decoded_id, "name": anime_name, "similarity": similarity, "genre": genre})
    Frame = pd.DataFrame(SimilarityArr).sort_values(by="similarity", ascending=False)
    return Frame[Frame.anime_id != index].drop(['anime_id'], axis=1)
```
- **Purpose**: Recommend animes similar to a given anime based on embeddings.
- **Significance**:
  - `np.dot`: Computes cosine similarity between the target anime and all others.
  - `argsort`: Ranks animes by similarity.
  - Returns a DataFrame with similar animes, excluding the input anime.
- **Theory**: Content-based filtering uses item similarity (here, embedding similarity) to recommend items.

### User-Based Recommendations

```python
def find_similar_users(item_input, user_weights, user2user_encoded, user2user_decoded, n=10, return_dist=False, neg=False):
    try:
        encoded_index = user2user_encoded.get(item_input)
        weights = user_weights
        dists = np.dot(weights, weights[encoded_index])
        sorted_dists = np.argsort(dists)
        n = n + 1
        if neg:
            closest = sorted_dists[:n]
        else:
            closest = sorted_dists[-n:]
        if return_dist:
            return dists, closest
        SimilarityArr = []
        for close in closest:
            similarity = dists[close]
            decoded_id = user2user_decoded.get(close)
            SimilarityArr.append({"similar_users": decoded_id, "similarity": similarity})
        similar_users = pd.DataFrame(SimilarityArr).sort_values(by="similarity", ascending=False)
        similar_users = similar_users[similar_users.similar_users != item_input]
        return similar_users
    except Exception as e:
        print("Error Occured", e)
def get_user_preferences(user_id, rating_df, df, plot=False):
    animes_watched_by_user = rating_df[rating_df.user_id == user_id]
    user_rating_percentile = np.percentile(animes_watched_by_user.rating, 75)
    animes_watched_by_user = animes_watched_by_user[animes_watched_by_user.rating >= user_rating_percentile]
    top_animes_user = animes_watched_by_user.sort_values(by="rating", ascending=False).anime_id.values
    anime_df_rows = df[df["anime_id"].isin(top_animes_user)]
    anime_df_rows = anime_df_rows[["eng_version", "Genres"]]
    if plot:
        getFavGenre(anime_df_rows, plot)
    return anime_df_rows
def get_user_recommendations(similar_users, user_pref, df, synopsis_df, rating_df, n=10):
    recommended_animes = []
    anime_list = []
    for user_id in similar_users.similar_users.values:
        pref_list = get_user_preferences(int(user_id), rating_df, df)
        pref_list = pref_list[~pref_list.eng_version.isin(user_pref.eng_version.values)]
        if not pref_list.empty:
            anime_list.append(pref_list.eng_version.values)
    if anime_list:
        anime_list = pd.DataFrame(anime_list)
        sorted_list = pd.DataFrame(pd.Series(anime_list.values.ravel()).value_counts()).head(n)
        for i, anime_name in enumerate(sorted_list.index):
            n_user_pref = sorted_list[sorted_list.index == anime_name].values[0][0]
            frame = getAnimeFrame(anime_name, df)

    return pd.DataFrame(recommended_animes).head(n)
```
- **Purpose**: Find similar users and recommend animes they like.
- **Significance**:
  - `find_similar_users`: Computes similarity between users using embeddings.
  - `get_user_preferences`: Identifies a user’s top-rated animes (above 75th percentile).
  - `get_user_recommendations`: Recommends animes liked by similar users, excluding those the target user has seen.
- **Theory**: Collaborative filtering assumes similar users share preferences, so their top-rated items are good recommendations.

### Hybrid Recommender System

```python
def hybrid_recommendation(user_id, user_weight=0.5, content_weight=0.5):
    similar_users = find_similar_users(user_id, user_weights, user2user_encoded, user2user_decoded)
    user_pref = get_user_preferences(user_id, rating_df, df)
    user_recommended_animes = get_user_recommendations(similar_users, user_pref, df, synopsis_df, rating_df)
    user_recommended_anime_list = user_recommended_animes["anime_name"].tolist()
    content_recommended_animes = []
    for anime in user_recommended_anime_list:
        similar_animes = find_similar_animes(anime, anime_weights, anime2anime_encoded, anime2anime_decoded, df, synopsis_df)
        if similar_animes is not None and not similar_animes.empty:
            content_recommended_animes.extend(similar_animes["name"].tolist())
    combined_scores = {}
    for anime in user_recommended_anime_list:
        combined_scores[anime] = combined_scores.get(anime, 0) + user_weight
    for anime in content_recommended_animes:
        combined_scores[anime] = combined_scores.get(anime, 0) + content_weight
    sorted_animes = sorted(combined_scores.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    return [anime for anime, score in sorted_animes[:10]]
```
- **Purpose**: Combine user-based and content-based recommendations.
- **Significance**:
  - Combines recommendations from `get_user_recommendations` and `find_similar_animes`.
  - Assigns weights (0.5 each) to balance contributions.
  - Sorts animes by combined scores.
- **Theory**: Hybrid systems leverage strengths of both approaches, improving recommendation diversity and robustness.

### Visualization

```python
def showWordCloud(all_genres):
    genres_cloud = WordCloud(width=700, height=400, background_color='white', colormap='gnuplot').generate_from_frequencies(all_genres)
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
    plt.imshow(genres_cloud, interpolation="bilinear")
    plt.axis("off")
    plt.show()
```
- **Purpose**: Visualize a user’s preferred genres as a word cloud.
- **Significance**: Helps interpret user preferences visually.
- **Theory**: Word clouds highlight frequent genres, aiding in understanding user tastes.

## Python Concepts for Beginners

1. **Imports**: Libraries like `pandas`, `numpy`, and `tensorflow` provide pre-built functionality. Use `import` to access them.
2. **DataFrames**: `pandas.DataFrame` is like a table (rows and columns). Use methods like `head()`, `sort_values()`, and `apply()` to manipulate data.
3. **Lists and Dictionaries**: Lists (`[]`) store ordered items; dictionaries (`{}`) store key-value pairs. Used heavily for encoding IDs.
4. **Lambda Functions**: Anonymous functions (e.g., `lambda x: ...`) for quick operations, like normalizing ratings.
5. **List Comprehensions**: Concise way to create lists (e.g., `[x for x in range(5)]`).
6. **Error Handling**: `try-except` blocks catch errors (e.g., missing anime IDs).
7. **Functions**: Defined with `def`, used to modularize code (e.g., `getAnimeName`).
8. **Array Indexing**: `numpy` arrays use `[:, 0]` to select columns (e.g., user IDs).

## Machine Learning Concepts for Beginners

1. **Neural Networks**: Models that learn patterns from data using layers of neurons. Here, used to learn embeddings.
2. **Embeddings**: Dense vectors representing users/items in a latent space. Capture relationships (e.g., similar tastes).
3. **Loss Function**: Measures prediction error (e.g., `binary_crossentropy` for [0, 1] outputs).
4. **Optimizer**: Adjusts model weights to minimize loss (e.g., `Adam`).
5. **Overfitting**: When a model performs well on training data but poorly on test data. Prevented by `EarlyStopping`.
6. **Cosine Similarity**: Measures similarity between vectors (used for user/anime similarity).
7. **Training/Validation Split**: Training data trains the model; validation data evaluates it.

## Conclusion

This Jupyter Notebook implements a sophisticated hybrid recommender system for anime recommendations, combining neural collaborative filtering with content-based filtering. The code is modular, with clear sections for data loading, preprocessing, model training, and recommendation generation. By understanding each line, the underlying theory, and the Python/ML concepts, you can confidently explain this system in an interview or use it as a foundation for further projects.

For future reference:
- **Practice**: Run the notebook, tweak parameters (e.g., `embedding_size`, weights), and explore results.
- **Extend**: Add more features (e.g., synopsis text embeddings) or try other algorithms (e.g., LightFM).
- **Study**: Review papers on neural collaborative filtering (He et al., 2017) and hybrid systems (Burke, 2002).

This document should serve as a comprehensive guide to revisit the code and concepts whenever needed.
